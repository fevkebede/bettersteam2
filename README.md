# TMGE INF122

**Instructions on how executing the jar file**

WE NEED THIS! JAR

## Description
- 1. Design and implement an extensible Tile-Matching Game Environment (TMGE).  We will adhere to the definition of a tile-matching game.
- 2. With a team of 5 or 6 people

**Requirements**
- 1. The TMGE should accommodate any tile-matching game that involves a grid layout and game elements on this layout, including games such as Tetris, Klax, Bejeweled, Bust-a-Move, Puzzle Bobble, Candy Crush, Dr. Mario, Puzzle Fighter, etc. 
- 2. The TMGE should make it as easy as possible to create implementations of new games.
- 3. The TMGE should provide a defined interface that all games built on top of the environment must follow.
- 4. The TMGE should support two players running on the same local machine.
- 5. The TMGE should support personal player profiles (the specifics of which are up to you). Login can be very simple and does not have to be secure.
- 6. The TMGE need only support 2-player games (but you can support more players if you want to).
- 7. The TMGE should work by providing a player with a list of games they can play and allow them to choose which one to start.
- 8. The TMGE  should be written in Java with modules specified and implemented using the Java Platform Module System. You must have, at least, 3 Java modules in your design.
- 9. The TMGE should only expose parts of itself necessary to build a game, hiding the internals of the TMGE that need not be used or extended by a game directly.
- 10. The TMGE  only needs to support running one game at a time.

**Deliverables**

- 1. The TMGE itself
- 2. Two or more games from the list above that are "built on top of" the TMGE. 
- 3. Documentation
- 4. Instructions for running the game
- 5. Code and runnable jar (via a CM repository like GitHub)
- 6. Peer evaluations (will be made available to you)
